by [Quenk Technologies Limited](http://quenk.com).

Quenk Technologies is an application engineering company located in Trinidad and
Tobago with a main focus on Information and Data management.

Most if not all of the code provided here is written from a functional programming
standpoint influenced by languages like Haskell, Purescript, Scheme, and even Erlang.

Everyone has there own reasons, for us it makes the design phase of APIs faster
and allows us to write more stable programs.
